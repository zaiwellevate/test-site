        <H1> The best movies according to me</H1>
        <h2> I don't really watch movies, but here are what I think are the best amongst all I've seen so far</h2>
        <hr>

        <h3>Whiplash</h3>
        <p>A lot of people can't see past the technicalities of the movie, and I think they're missing out on the whole point that the film is trying to get across</p>
        <br>

        <h3>The hunger games: The ballad of songbirds and snakes</h3>
        <p>I love me a good woman who knows her worth especially at the time when the film is set. Also lmao, that situationship could've gone better if Cornelius got therapy</p>
        <br>

        <h3>The grave of fireflies</h3>
        <p> *cries uncontrollably* </p>
